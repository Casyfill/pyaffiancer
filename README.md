fuzzy_match and data reconciler for pandas

As a data journalist, main struggle I had for a long time, was dirty data. In fact, most data DJ have to work, wasn't intendet to be used as data per se; Many forms, surveys, record tables, etc. are hand-written or hand-typed by many different people, and, therefore, all have numerous typos, misspeling and naming variations. 
  That is why, even already writing python code, I ofthen had to use one of a few data cleaning tools, and, first of all, [Open Refine](link).
